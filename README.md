# MosaicRenderer

MosaicRenderer is a small Matlab library containing functionality to create uniform grid mosaic images (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_mosaic).

The library supports simple blur filtering, fast sampling (using dnsearch), resizing and cropping of mosaic images as a preprocessing step before render, amongst other features. In addition to aforementioned features, it also stores the resulting renders for reuse (separate upcoming project).


Installation
---
To install the library, simply add the path to 'renderer' using addpath.
