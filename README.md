# MosaicRenderer

MosaicRenderer is a small Matlab library containing functionality to create uniform grid mosaic images (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_mosaic).

The library supports simple blur filtering, fast sampling (using dnsearch), resizing and cropping of mosaic images as a preprocessing step before render, amongst other features. In addition to aforementioned features, it also stores the resulting renders for reuse (separate upcoming project).


Installation
---
To install the library, simply add the path to 'renderer' using addpath.


How to generate mosaic element from movies
---
Download ffmpeg https://www.ffmpeg.org/. Given a filename, type in your terminal

```code
ffmpeg.exe -i "movie_filename.avi" -r 0.2 -f image2 image%03d.jpeg
```

If the source video contains black borders you can crop the video using

```code
-vf "crop=1280:520:0:100"
```

The generated images can then be used by the renderer (see constants.m).

To run the mosaic generator:

1 - adjust the constants (renderer/constants.m) and run it.

2 - run demos/rendermosaics.m which will use the constants from the previous step to find the source mosaic images (moselsDir), where to put the created mosaic images (outputDir) and which images to use to create mosaics from (mosaicDir), the finished mosaic images will be moved to mosaicMoveDir when they are finished.


mosaicPaletteDir contains the json and palette image which is used by my mosaic viewer (https://github.com/MatzJB/Javascript-experiments/tree/master/mosaicViewer/src).


The json file generated by the render is a simple layout of the mosaic images that is used to build the mosaic image in an efficient way.


Example of a json 
```json
{
"spriteMap":"spritemap_Time Lapse.json", 
"metadata": 
  {
    "columns": 59,
    "rows": 225
  },
"compressionRatio": 0.012505,
"mosaicIndices": [
  871,
  871,
  871]
}
```

Viewer
---
I have written an efficient mosaic viewer in Javascript/ThreeJS that takes the generated json files and allows the viewer to zoom in and out of the mosaic image.
